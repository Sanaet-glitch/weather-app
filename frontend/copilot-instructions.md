# Next.js Frontend with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and RippleUI

This project is a Next.js application using TypeScript.
The primary UI component library is RippleUI (ripple-ui.com), which is based on Tailwind CSS.
All frontend components should be styled using Tailwind CSS and utilize RippleUI components where appropriate.
AJAX requests to the backend should be made using the native `fetch` API.
Ensure all code is type-safe and well-commented.
Follow Next.js best practices, including using the App Router.
The application should match the visual design specified in the wireframe: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b2c0PGxCRV34K06jz_D_OGpPKPR7CrVByB8OYmL33xY/edit?tab=t.0
The main page to display the weather is `src/app/page.tsx`.
The application will fetch weather data from a backend Laravel API.
